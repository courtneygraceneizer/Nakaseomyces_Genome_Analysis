ðŸ§¬ Genome Analysis and Transcription Factor Regulation in Nakaseomyces nivariensis
 GitHub Repository (Coming Soon!)
 
 Overview: Conducted de novo genome assembly and annotation of N. nivariensis to investigate antifungal resistance mechanisms. Identified UPC2, a key transcription factor regulating sterol biosynthesis genes, which may contribute to antifungal drug resistance.

ðŸ”¬ Key Research Components:

Genomic Assembly & Annotation: Utilized SLURM, Trimmomatic, SAMtools, and BEDtools for sequence processing.

Transcription Factor Analysis: Identified and characterized UPC2 as a potential regulator of sterol biosynthesis genes.

Comparative Genomics: Assessed UPC2â€™s regulatory role in N. nivariensis relative to Candida species to infer antifungal resistance pathways.

ðŸš€ Impact: This research enhances our understanding of transcriptional regulation in antifungal resistance and provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for drug-resistant fungal infections.
